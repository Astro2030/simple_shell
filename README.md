Simple_Shell Program

Description
The Simple Shell Program is a basic command-line interface that emulates
a simple shell. It allows users to interact with their operating system by
entering commands to perform various tasks such as navigating the file system,
executing programs, and managing processes.

This shell program is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, making it
suitable for educational purposes or as a starting point for building more complex shell applications.

Features

Command Execution: Users can enter commands and execute them, just like in a regular shell.

Built-in Commands: The shell supports a few built-in commands, such as cd (change directory)
and exit (terminate the shell).

Command Line Editing: Basic command line editing features, such as navigating with arrow keys,
backspacing, and deleting characters, are supported.

History: The shell keeps track of the command history, allowing users to access previously entered
commands using the up and down arrow keys.
